- name: JARVIS - Virtual Home Assistant
  url: https://github.com/srikanthkarre/JARVIS
  code: https://github.com/srikanthkarre/JARVIS
  description: Developed a <strong>voice module</strong> which converts voice commands from user into text commands using google speech-to-text (STT) engine. These commands are then sent to raspberry pi which sends control signals to home appliances. Developed an android application using java integrated with Vuforia Object Scanner library to <strong>identify objects</strong> and send appropriate signals to raspberry pi to control home appliances. The assistant is easy to use and <strong>specially designed for visually challenged, speech impaired and physically disabled people</strong>.
