  description: A reinforcement learning Automated tutoring agent that interacts with the student and choose the activities/topics that help students maximize knowledge by selecting topics to review sequentially and effectively, which is also known as <strong>spaced repetition learning</strong> . Spaced Repetition is formulated as a POMDP environmentin the paper and our primary contribution is to create an automated tutor which takes an observation of student answering question and chooses the next question to review or learn.
