  description: <p>Built a feature on a WPF app to automate the process of capturing 360 degree screenshot of a Virtual Reality Experience video and converting the screenshots into equirectangular views 90, 270, 360 degree yaw angles apart.</p> <p>Developed an API to retrieve these screenshots and a web portal to display these images for easy access to the Data Science team. This removed the manual overhead and <strong>reduced the total time needed to get the screenshots by 99.99%</strong>.</p> <p>Currently working on automating testing the code base before deloying to production in Azure pipelines.</p>
