      I'm currently an Computer Science graduate student at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://cs.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a>, <a class="underline-link" href="https://cs.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.</a> 
      I'm fascinated by the world of Machine Learning and Cloud Technologies.

      As a software engineering student, I enjoy solving problems and building extensible solutions. My goal is to inspire others 
      like me to look at the bigger picture and create more scalable solutions. This website contains all of my past and current 
      projects that have solutions to beneficial problems. I hope that many others can extrapolate information and make them better.

      Currently I am working as a software engineering intern at STRIVR. Currently I have been learning how effective VR is in 
      the <strong>immersive learning</strong> space. Automating key features in STRIVR's VR program creation application to facilitate report generation on users. 
      Working a lot with 360 &#176; videos, images, this has applications in Biomedical Image Enhancement & Analysis,
       Computer Vision essencially in processing videos, images.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably exploring food places, playing Basketball,
      or reading a book (currently reading the Millionaire Fastlane by MJ Demarco).
