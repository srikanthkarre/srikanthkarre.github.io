      I'm currently an Computer Science graduate student at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://cs.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">New York University</a>, <a class="underline-link" href="https://cs.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.</a> 
      I'm fascinated by the world of Machine Learning and Cloud Technologies.

      As a software engineering student, I enjoy solving problems and building extensible solutions. My goal is to inspire others 
      like me to look at the bigger picture and create more scalable solutions. This website contains all of my past and current 
      projects that have solutions to beneficial problems. I hope that many others can extrapolate information and make them better.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.

      Currently I am working as a software engineering intern at STRIVR. Currently I have been learning how AR can be used in
       shopping industry and schools for teaching Mathematics, Physics and other subjects. building AR applciations for online 
       shopping and educational training like how AR can be used in schools for teaching Mathematics, Physics and various other subjects.

      Additionally, I am also leading the development of Core-ML IOS Application which combines machine learning, computer vision and 
      AR together. For more details please check out my medium blog.

      I also teach Graduate Fundamental Algorithms with Professor Rick Hull at NYU. Teaching that course has allowed me to help other
      graduate students reach their full potential and has allowed me to gain a completely different perspective on algorithms.

      Prior to this, I was working as a software engineer at Pykih building data driven and interactive web applications, dashboards,
       reports, visual essays and analytics.

    When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I like to travel, hitt the gym, or just read a book (currently reading Trillion Dollar Coach).
